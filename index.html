<p>
The dots connected with lines mark various trajectories of a particle. In quantum mechanics, the way one calculates the probability that a particle starting at point A will be at point B a fixed time T later is by calculating the action for each possible trajectory and rotating a little vector by this action. Then one lays all the little vectors tip-to-tail. The square of the sum of these vectors is proportional to the probability that the particle will go from A to B in time T. In mathspeak: one is integrating over all possible paths from A to B, but it is a vector quantity that one is integrating. The phase of each vector in the integrand is itself the result of an integral along the path that that vector represents.

<p>
On the right of the simulation one can see the vector addition of the little arrows. The resultant is in red.

Use the dropdown menu to pick a potential energy function and the slider to control the number of paths.
Use the mouse to select the dots and adjust the trajectories.
